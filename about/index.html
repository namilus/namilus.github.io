A research project conducted as part of Erasmus exchange. The project included writing a library to extract finite temporality strings from texts and a probabilistic analysis of the relations that hold between temporal events. The full paper is available <a href="file:///home/namilus/projects/blog/assets/ERASMUS-RESEARCH-PROJECT-Mohamed-Suliman-17327728.pdf">here</a>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5b34e04">
<p>
The system we were asked to develop, as part of a group was a call screening agent that uses the IBM Watson technology. The agent connects callers to an Emergency Medical Dispatcher (EMD) if they are reporting an incident that is not yet known about or if they have further information about one. This agent will solve the problem of emergency services becoming overwhelmed with several incoming calls all reporting the same incident.
</p>

<p>
For the project, I was in charge of the development of the database, that was developed using MongoDB. An intermediate RESTful API was developed in order to query the database via HTTP requests. 
I was also in charge of developing the Watson Assistant and it’s Cloud Function using IBM’s Watson Natural Language Processing facilities.
</p>

<p>
The supervisor from IBM, had the following to say about the quality of the project:
“You have been very enthusiastic about tackling the challenge and I think you have made much more progress than I would have expected from a student project.”
